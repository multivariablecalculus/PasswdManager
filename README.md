# Passwd Manager

It is a CLI-based Password Manager with a simple entry based password saving system with a few more features, now if you are in Windows you can simply put the executable in the C:bin directory and run the run the passwd.bat file either in cmd or terminal and the program will be called; or if yuo are in linux, just chmod the permission on this file and put the exectutable in the root directory and you can simple run using passwd after configuring the executable name, then run on bash or zsh.

Then again enjoy, you can heavily customize it will color unicodes and all but, I was lazy so I did not do that.

Cheers, fellow coders!
